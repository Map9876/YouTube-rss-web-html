                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Why another feed reader?</h6>
                    <p>Honestly, I built this for myself because a few weeks ago, Omnivore announced <a
                            class="modal-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">they were joining ElevenLabs</a> and <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"> shutting down their service.</a> I started searching for a new
                        one but thought, why not try building one myself? And here I am. My initial plan was to create
                        an Android app, but I temporarily settled for this. Maybe someday I'll revisit the idea.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">What is an RSS feed?</h6>
                    <p>
                        RSS feeds provide updates about the latest posts, blogs, or articles from a website. For
                        example, you can check this feed: <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The
                            Verge RSS feed</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">How can I find an RSS feed for a website?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Many blogs and websites have RSS feeds by default. To check, visit <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://feedsearch.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feedsearch</a> and
                        paste any website URL. It will show if an RSS feed is available.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Why use RSS feeds?</h6>
                    <p>When you subscribe to an RSS feed using an RSS reader app, you get updates directly in your feed.
                        This saves you from manually checking websites, newsletters, or profiles. You can curate your
                        own news feed and stay in control of what you want to see. <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://romio.substack.com/p/rss-feeds-vs-email-subscriptions" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Shared a blog here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Which RSS reader apps should I try?</h6>
                    <p>If you're not happy here you can check out the Vivaldi browser, it includes an RSS reader, so you
                        can use it without relying on third-party apps. However, this feature is currently unavailable
                        on their mobile app. Other options include apps like <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://feeder.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feeder</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Do RSS feeds only show a few posts and replace old ones?</h6>
                    <p>Yes, RSS feeds typically show a limited number of recent posts (e.g., 10-20), and older ones are
                        replaced as new content is added. To keep track of older posts, you can <a class="modal-link"
                            href="https://raindrop.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookmark or save the
                            link using a service like Raindrop</a>.</p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">What is a CORS proxy, and why is it used?</h6>
                    <p>
                        A CORS proxy allows the app to fetch RSS feeds from different domains by bypassing cross-origin
                        restrictions.
                        This ensures the app can access and display feeds from various sources seamlessly.
                        For this app, I used the <a class="modal-link" href="https://allorigins.win/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">AllOrigins</a> CORS proxy serviceâ€”thank you for the great service!
                        The proxy acts as an intermediary, fetching the feed content and returning it to the app for
                        display.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">How often are the feeds refreshed?</h6>
                    <p>The feeds are refreshed every 6 hours. The application uses a service worker to cache the feed
                        data and set an expiration time of 6 hours. After this period, the feed data is refreshed from
                        the server.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">What happens if I manually refresh the feeds?</h6>
                    <p>You can manually refresh the feeds by pressing "Ctrl+F5" the tab (On mobile, swipe down twice).
                        This triggers a fresh fetch of the feed data, bypassing the cache.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">What happens if I clear my browser data, including cache and cookies?
                    </h6>
                    <p>If you clear your browser data, including cache and cookies, the cached feed data, configured
                        feeds and the last fetched timestamps will be lost. The application will need to fetch the feed
                        data fresh from the server the next time you select a feed.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Where is my data processed?</h6>
                    <p>All data processing, including filtering and rendering, happens locally within your browser. Your
                        configured feeds are stored in your browser's local storage.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Is my data sent to any servers?</h6>
                    <p>No, your configured feeds and search data are not sent to any external servers. All operations
                        are performed locally within your browser.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Remember to periodically download CSV backup</h6>
                    <p>
                        If you regularly add feed URLs manually, I suggest you use the Google Sheet way for easier
                        management. However, if that feels like too much work, remember to download the CSV every now
                        and then to keep a backup of your feeds.
                    </p>


                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">How is the selected feed preserved across page reloads?
                    </h6>
                    <p>The selected feed URL is stored in local storage. On page reload, the application retrieves the
                        selected feed URL from local storage and sets the dropdown accordingly. This ensures that your
                        feed selection is preserved across page reloads.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">Add on: Personal Telegram bot for sending RSS feed updates to a Telegram
                        channel</h6>
                    <p>This script allows you to fetch RSS feeds, check for new posts, and send them to a Telegram
                        channel. The script uses Google Apps Script to handle the RSS feed fetching, Telegram messaging,
                        and Google Sheets for tracking sent posts. <a class="modal-link"

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">How to get a YouTube channel's RSS feed?</h6>
                    <p>To find the YouTube RSS feed for a channel, go to the channel's page. Right-click on the page and
                        choose "View Page Source." Then, search for `channel_id=` in the source code. Copy the value
                        that follows, which is the channel's ID. To create the feed URL, use the format:
                        `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID`. Replace `CHANNEL_ID` with the
                        ID you copied. This will give you the RSS feed for that channel.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subtle-heading">These FAQs were also created by Mistral AI</h6>
                    <p>I shared the entire project code with Mistral AI and asked it to generate FAQs based on the
                        code.
